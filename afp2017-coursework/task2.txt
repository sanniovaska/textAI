Sandra journeyed to the bedroom
Mary took the football
John went to the kitchen
Mary went to the garden
Sandra journeyed to the hallway
Sandra took the apple
Mary moved to the hallway
John journeyed to the kitchen
John moved to the hallway
John took the milk
Mary journeyed to the bedroom
John journeyed to the kitchen
